# GettingAndCleaningDataCoursera
Course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data course" offered on Coursera

* The analysis is implemented in run_Analysis.R.
* The script can be run at the R command line as follows: source('run_Analysis.R')
* The script has only been tested on a Mac (OS Yosemite)
* The script does the following:
** Download the data set from the web
** Unzip the data set
** Combine the training and test data into a data table
** Extract features which have mean or std in their names
** Compute the mean of each feature on a per subject, per activity basis.
** Write the results to a file

* The dataset is organized as follows:
** Column 1: Subject ID (range 1 to 30)
** Column 2: Activity ID (range 1 to 6), where each index maps to an activity as described below
** Columns 3:81: Average value per subject, per activity of various features extracted from raw data

* The activity index to physical activity mapping is as follows:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

A full list of features can be found in the file features_info.txt. Of these features, only the mean() and std() values were used for creating the data set presented here (79 such features were found). Further the means and standard deviation features were average to yield a single number per subject, per activity. Since there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, the data has 180 rows. Since 79 features were found, the data has 81 columns (2 extra for subject and activity ID, as described above).
